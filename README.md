# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

This folder captures my **hands-on Python journey** — from basics to small projects, scripts, and experiments.  
I’m learning by **building, iterating, and documenting key takeaways** as I explore Python for **ETL, automation, and problem-solving**.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Practice Python fundamentals** and real-world coding  
- **Build small utilities and mini-projects**  
- **Apply Python to data handling, APIs, and automation**  
- **Document my growth and lessons learned**

## 📂 Structure

- **basics/** – Syntax, loops, functions, data types  
- **scripts/** – Small utilities and experiments  
- **mini_projects/** – Practical mini-projects  
- **notes/** – Tips, snippets, and reflections  

## 🔑 My Approach

- **Learn by building** → no passive reading  
- **Iterate constantly** → refactor as I improve  
- **Document everything** → notes for myself and for others  
- **Celebrate small wins** and track progress
