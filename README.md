# 👋 Welcome to Learn_Python

Hi, I’m **Ankita**!

This is the space to share my **Python journey**. Whether you’re here to explore my projects, learn with me, or just browse ideas, you’re in the right place!  

This folder captures my **hands-on Python journey** - from basics to small projects, scripts, and experiments.  
I’m learning by **building, iterating, and documenting key takeaways** as I explore Python for **automation, and problem-solving**.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Practice Python fundamentals** and real-world coding  
- **Build small utilities and mini-projects**  
- **Apply Python to data handling, APIs, and automation**  
- **Document my growth and lessons learned**

## ✨ My Learning Journey

I believe in **learning by doing**. I use this repo to:  
- Experiment with Python for automation and data analysis  
- Apply QA and performance testing knowledge in practical examples  
- Build templates and scripts that can be reused in real projects

## 🔑 My Approach

- **Document everything** → notes for myself and for others  
- **Celebrate small wins** and track progress
